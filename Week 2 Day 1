--Relational Database Management System
--Relationships create connections between records and fields
--Fields that repeat across tables tend to be in a relationship
	--On one side = Primany key
	--Other side foreign key
--Primary key (PK)
	--Unique field in a table
	--Each table should have a primary key
--Foreign key (FK)
	--Match to a primary key in another table
	--Each FK will have a matching PK - when done correctly 
		--Referential integrity
--Joins
	--PK -> FK matchup
	--Where FK in a table matches the PK in another table
	--Able to combine the records in the tables
--Exceptions to the matching fields
